Welcome to my blog. This is where I'll share my thoughts on technology, programming, and whatever else captures my interest.

Starting a blog has been on my list for a while. There's something valuable about writing down your thoughts—it forces you to clarify your thinking and creates a record you can look back on.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- Programming and software development
- Tools and workflows that I find useful
- Lessons learned from projects
- Interesting problems and their solutions

Thanks for stopping by. Stay tuned for more posts.
